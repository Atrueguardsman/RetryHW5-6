H/W 5:
Providing data set with implications of correlating attachments, 
with POC and verifying if the 
attachment contain malicious content sending in,
 or sensitive information sent out. Using Pandas to format data and review content and finding the best way 
to determine a insider threat based on messages.


H/W 6:
The most likely case i think would be is reviewing attachments that are coming in and out through emails

material leaving would be in the form of protection with data loss prevention and correlating the From POC
that sending out the attachments, and then seeing a pattern in the "from" data frames, with the "to" data frames 
to determine a pattern of causation.

Next, providing visualization to find metrics on the POC that had attachmentsthe more attachments, the more likely to begin investigating the data with them first
Then verifying the body of the message with the associated attachment.
